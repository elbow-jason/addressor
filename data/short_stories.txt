A kitten (also known as a kitty or kitty cat) is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens are totally dependent on their mother for survival and they do not normally open their eyes until after seven to ten days. After about two weeks, kittens quickly develop and begin to explore the world outside the nest. After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow adult teeth. Domestic kittens are highly social animals and enjoy human companionship.

Etymology and development
The word "kitten" derives from the Middle English word kitoun, which in turn came from the Old French chitoun or cheton.[1] The big cats are called "cubs" rather than kittens; either term may be used for the young of smaller wild felids, such as ocelots, caracals and lynx, but "kitten" is usually more common for these species.[2]

A feline litter usually consists of two to five kittens.[3] The kits are born after a gestation that lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average length of 66 days.[3] Kittens emerge in a sac called the amnion, which is bitten off and eaten by the mother cat.[4]
For the first several weeks, kittens are unable to urinate or defecate without being stimulated by their mother.[5] They are also unable to regulate their body temperature for the first three weeks, so kittens born in temperatures less than 27 °C (81 °F) can die from hypothermia if their mother does not keep them warm.[6] The mother's milk is very important for the kittens' nutrition and proper growth. This milk transfers antibodies to the kittens, which helps protect them against infectious disease.[7] Newborn kittens are unable to produce concentrated urine, and so have a very high requirement for fluids.[8] Kittens open their eyes about seven to ten days after birth. At first, the retina is poorly developed and vision is poor. Kittens are not able to see as well as adult cats until about ten weeks after birth.[9]
Kittens develop very quickly from about two weeks of age until their seventh week. Their coordination and strength improve. They play-fight with their litter-mates and begin to explore the world outside the nest or den. They learn to wash themselves and others as well as play hunting and stalking games, showing their inborn ability as predators. These innate skills are developed by the kittens' mother or other adult cats, who bring live prey to the nest. Later, the adult cats demonstrate hunting techniques for the kittens to emulate.[10] As they reach three to four weeks old, the kittens are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food, with weaning usually complete by six to eight weeks.[11] Kittens generally begin to lose their baby teeth around three months of age, and have a complete set of adult teeth by nine months.[12] Kittens live primarily on solid food after weaning, but usually continue to suckle from time to time until separated from their mothers. Some mother cats will scatter their kittens as early as three months of age, while others continue to look after them until they approach sexual maturity.[13]
The sex of kittens is usually easy to determine at birth. By six to eight weeks they are harder to sex because of the growth of fur in the genital region. The male's urethral opening is round, whereas the female's urethral opening is a slit. Another marked difference is the distance between anus and urethral opening, which is greater in males than in females.[14]
Kittens are highly social animals and spend most of their waking hours interacting with available animals and playing on their own. Play with other kittens peaks in the third or fourth month after birth, with more solitary hunting and stalking play peaking later, at about five months.[15]
Kittens are vulnerable because they like to find dark places to hide, sometimes with fatal results if they are not watched carefully.[16]
Although domestic kittens are commonly sent to new homes at six to eight weeks of age, it has been suggested that being with its mother and litter mates from six to twelve weeks is important for a kitten's social and behavioural development.[15] Usually, breeders and foster/rescue homes will not sell or adopt out a kitten that is younger than twelve weeks, and in many jurisdictions, it is illegal to give away kittens younger than eight weeks old.[17] Kittens generally reach sexual maturity around seven months of age. A cat reaches full "adulthood" around one year of age.[18]
Health
Domestic kittens in developed societies are usually vaccinated against common illnesses from two to three months of age. The usual combination vaccination protects against feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR), feline calicivirus (C), and feline panleukopenia (P). This FVRCP inoculation is usually given at eight, twelve, and sixteen weeks, and an inoculation against rabies may be given at sixteen weeks. Kittens are usually spayed or neutered at seven months of age, but kittens may be neutered as young as seven weeks (if large enough), especially in animal shelters.[19] Such early neutering does not appear to have any long-term health risks to cats, and may even be beneficial in male cats.[20] Kittens are commonly wormed against roundworms from about four weeks.[21]
Orphaned kittens

Kittens require a high-calorie diet that contains more protein than the diet of adult cats.[22] Young orphaned kittens require cat milk every two to four hours, and they need physical stimulation to defecate and urinate.[5] Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young kittens, because cow's milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients.[23] Human-reared kittens tend to be very affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than kittens reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression.[24] Depending on the age at which they were orphaned and how long they were without their mothers, these kittens may be severely underweight and can have health problems later in life, such as heart conditions. The compromised immune system of orphaned kittens (from lack of antibodies found naturally in the mother's milk) can make them especially susceptible to infections, making antibiotics a necessity.[25]

The Mischievous Dog
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 9h ago
This is the short story once upon a time of, “The Mischievous Dog” to read for kids. Once upon a time, a man had a pet dog. To his demise, the dog was as ill-mannered as he was mischievous. The dog had an awful habit of creeping around and creating unwanted trouble for everyone. Whenever the dog saw people, he quietly crept behind them. And then, suddenly the dog would bite them, without any warning. You may also like to read, The Greedy Dog.

The dog’s master had become utterly worried. His troublesome dog had created nothing but trouble for him. “I shall tie a bell around his neck,” the master of the dog one announced. He had grown tired of his dog and his mischiefs. The man bought a bell and tied it to his dog’s neck. After the man tied a bell around the dog’s neck, the dog ran around the neighborhood. Wherever the dog went, the ringing sound of the bell followed him.

“Look, look,” the mischievous dog boasted to his friends, “my master gave me such a wonderful present.” The foolish dog never realized his master’s true intentions. “Why did you tie a bell around your dog’s neck?” a person asked the dog’s master.

“I was tired of his mischiefs,” the mischievous dog’s master replied. “The dog was notorious and caused too much trouble for his own good. He would creep up from behind and bite people, for no apparent reason. With a bell around his neck, he is easier to follow.” Everyone realized how wise the dog’s master was. Also, read The Dog Who Went Abroad.

One day, the mischievous dog was boasting about the bell to some other dog. The mischievous dog had grown proud of the bell around his neck. An old hound was observing the mischievous dog. “Why must you make a show off your bell?” asked the old hound.

The mischievous dog was quick to reply, “It is wonderful, is it not?” “It is not,” the old hound told him. “This bell was not given to you as a present for good deeds. It is rather a mark of disgrace on your end. You troubled your master to such great extents, that he had to suspend a bell around your neck, to know about your whereabouts!”

MORAL: THOSE WHO ATTAIN A BAD REPUTATION, MISTAKE IT FOR FAME.

The Hidden Treasure Story
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 1d ago
This is the hidden treasure story for kids to read. Once upon a time, in a small secluded village lived an old man. He had four sons. All of them had grown up into big men. Despite being grown-ups, the farmer’s sons never worked. The sons believed that their luck would take them along with their lives. “These sons of mine,” the farmer found himself wondering most of the time, “what will they do when I leave?” You may also like to read, The Greatest Treasure.

One day, the poor farmer fell sick. It seemed, the poor man would not make it. Even on his death bed, the man was worried sick about his sons and their futures. “They will surely be doomed, if they don’t do something about themselves,” the farmer thought. As all worried fathers do, he too came up with a plan to teach his sons a valuable lesson. He called his sons before he died. “There is a treasure hidden in the farmland,” the old man had told his sons before he died, “the most worthy will find the treasure.”

Image Source–> www.youtube.com. The old farmer’s sons took their father’s last words seriously. All of them took to digging up the vast farmland their father left them with. Each of them dug the farm, until sunset every day. They worked hard, digging until the entire farm was dug up. But all that work gave no result, it was just barren land.

“Where is the treasure?” one of them asked after they had dug the farm. “This just a barren land, was there even a treasure to be found?” complained another one of them. A passerby heard the commotion and came to see what the fuss was about. He saw that the farm was dug up properly. He saw the farmer’s sons talking nearby. “Young men,” the passerby called them. “Since you have already dug up the farm, why don’t you plant some seed?” he suggested. Also, read Treasure Island.

The farmer’s sons did not like the idea. After some discussions, they decided it would not hurt them much. So, they planted the new seeds. Soon the seeds grew into healthy crops. They sold the crops in the market and received a good sum of money in return.

“So, this was the treasure father was talking about,” one of the four brothers realized. Their father had tricked his sons into digging the farm, which eventually led to them planting the seeds. They realized nothing in life came free of cost, hard work was required to gain something. The four brothers overcame their laziness and worked hard for their future. Also, read Treasure In The Vineyard.

MORAL: “HARD WORK ALWAYS PAYS OFF” OR “NO PAIN, NO GAIN.”

Kallo And The Goblins
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 4d ago

Marbo, similar to her mother was vast and extremely fat whereas Kallo was slender and beautiful. The villagers and the people all loved Kallo. They praised

The villagers and the people all loved Kallo. They praised Kallo and her beauty. Marbo became extremely jealous of her younger sister. As a result, Kallo was forced to do all the chores of the house. She did her share of the work as well as Marbo’s. Also read, Stone Soup Story.

One day, the mother went into the pantry to look for some flour but did not find any. “Marbo,” the mother called, “will you go to the mill and grind some wheat?” “No, send Kallo instead,” Marbo bluntly replied.

So, Kallo loaded their donkey with sacks of wheat and went to the mill. As soon as Kallo reached the mill, she saw many people waiting their turn. Kallo too waited for her turn to grind wheat. But by the time it was Kallo’s turn, the sun had set and it had already become dark.

The miller went to sleep after pouring the wheat into the milestone. Kallo was left alone, with a small oil lamp. Around midnight, Kallo heard footsteps approaching the mill. When she turned around, Kallo found goblins sneaking into the mill. It was a whole gang of goblins! “We’ll eat you! We’ll eat Kallo!” the goblins shrieked, running around her in a circle.

“You can’t eat Kallo,” replied Kallo. “Not in this dirty old dress.” That sent the goblins scuttling around the mill and out to bring the finest dress for Kallo. “Now, we shall eat Kallo!” the goblins sang. “Not yet,” said Kallo again. “You can’t eat Kallo barefoot.” You may also like to read, The Giving Tree Story.

“Shoes, shoes, shoes,” they mumbled as they searched for the shoes. They came back with a pretty pair of shoes. “Now then, we shall eat Kallo,” the goblins sang. “No, not like this, Kallo does not have a coat,” Kallo sighed. When the goblins brought  Kallo a fur coat, she asked for a pair of gloves, then for an umbrella and so on. The clever girl made the goblins run for different things the whole night.

The clever girl made the goblins run for different things the whole night. When the daylight came, and the cries of roosters filled the air, the goblins ran into hiding. They could not survive in the daylight. Soon the miller woke up and began grinding Kallo’s share of wheat. In the meantime, Kallo loaded her donkey with the things the goblins had brought her.

In the meantime, Kallo loaded her donkey with the things the goblins had brought her. Kallo’s mother was surprised when she saw the things her younger daughter had brought in. “What is all this?” her mother asked. “The goblins in the mill gave them to me,” she replied.

Marbo became jealous of her sister yet again. As a result, Marbo wasted all the flour Kallo had brought home. Now, on New Year’s day, the mother found no flour. Marbo was sent to get the flour from the mill. Unfortunately, Marbo gained nothing.

Marbo’s jealousy had taken Marbo to the mill, but she did not have Kallo’s wits. The goblins scratched Marbo’s face and tried to eat her. Marbo screamed out in pain. Luckily, the miller heard Marbo’s cries and came to her rescue. Also read, The Brave Little Tailor Story.

In the end, Marbo’s face was treated with the face powder Kallo had received from the goblins. And Marbo learnt her lesson. When Kallo observed Marbo’s sadness, she spilt half of her gifts with Marbo. Since that day, the mother and the two sisters lived happily ever after.

Hawk and the Nightingale
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 5d ago
This is a great aesop fables story, “Hawk And The Nightingale”. One sunny afternoon a hawk set out to search for food. He flew through the sky, looking for a suitable prey. All day he flew from one place to another, but he found nothing.  “I should return home now,” hawk decided. He had become tired by now. Just when he was about to return home, a nightingale caught the hawk’s eye.

The nightingale was sitting peacefully on a branch and minding its own business. After seeing the nightingale, the hawk was extremely relieved. “Now, I won’t have to go to sleep on an empty stomach,” thought the hawk. “This nightingale shall be my prey,” the hawk thought. The hawk-eyed the nightingale greedily and flew towards the branch on which the nightingale was sitting on. Also read, The Nightingale Story.

The nightingale knew the hawk would eat the nightingale. After, catching the nightingale the hawk flew off to a rock. When they reached the rock, the nightingale tried to plead for her life. “Great hawk,” the nightingale started, “I sing sweetly. I will sing beautiful songs for you if you do not eat me.”

“Besides, I am very small for the great hawk’s stomach,” the nightingale continued. “Please, great hawk, spare my life!” The hawk laughed loudly and told the little nightingale, “But you see little nightingale, beautiful music does not fill up an empty stomach.”

“But, please great hawk reconsider,” the poor nightingale continued to plead. “I am such a tiny bird, I won’t be able to satisfy your hunger.” The poor nightingale began crying at this point. “But why should I let you go?” the wicked hawk laughed. “It is always better to have something to eat. A little catch always better than the larger catch that I have not yet caught.”

The nightingale realized it was useless to plead for its life now. It was useless to plead before a cruel enemy. The nightingale gave up and the hawk ate the nightingale in one gulp. You may also like to read, Paying Back In The Same Coin.

Swan Lake Story
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Shreya Sharma    - 1w ago
This is The Swan Lake Story. Once upon a time, there was a handsome Prince. His name was Siegfried. One day, he went hunting in the forest and came upon a beautiful lake. He saw many white swans playing in the water. As it became night, the swans went ashore and one by one changed into beautiful girls.

One of the girls was much more beautiful than the others. The Prince couldn’t help but approach her and say, “I’m Prince Siegfried. If you have any trouble, it’s my wish to be of assistance to you.” “I’m Princess Odette. My servant girls and I were put under a curse by the sorcerer Rothbart. That is why we became swans.” Also, read Wild Swans.

I’ll go look for this Sorcerer Rothbart and try to break the spell. I’ll take revenge for you!” The Prince was determined. Suddenly, an owl flew out from the dark of the forest and began attacking the Prince. It was Sorcerer Rothbart who had changed into an owl. There was not a hint of fear on the Prince’s face.After a few rounds with the owl, he had chased him away. Odette was very appreciative of him.

“Beautiful Princess, how can I break the curse?” he asked. “Only if you publicly ask for my hand in marriage will the sorcerer’s curse be broken and I can return to normal,” said the Princess bashfully. The Prince grabbed the Princess’ hand and said, “That’s easy. Tomorrow evening, my mother is holding a banquet for me to choose a bride. I’ll ask for your hand in marriage in front of everybody.”

The next day, a ball was held in the palace. Many pretty girls attended the ball, but the Prince considered no one but Princess Odette. As the ball was about to end, a noble, beautiful Princess ran into the palace from outside. The Prince excitedly grabbed her hand and announced before everybody, “Princess Odette is the girl of my dreams. I’ve decided to marry her.” You may also like to read, The Crow And The Peacock Story.

“Prince, that girl is Rothbart’s daughter. I’m the real Princess Odette!” said the girl outside the palace entrance. The Prince turned around and looked, “Yes, you’re Princess Odette. How could I ever forget your most beautiful yet sad countenance.” The fake Odette completely changed back into her evil self. “Haha! Too late! You’ve already asked me to marry you. My father’s curse will never be lifted.”

Suddenly, Sorcerer Rothbart appeared. Infuriated, the Prince pulled out his sword. In a flash, he lunged toward the sorcerer and with one stroke stabbed him in the throat. The sorcerer fell over dead in a pool of blood. “Now, I’ll never be able to change back to normal!” Princess Odette overridden with despair ran over to a cliff. She jumped head first into Swan Lake. When the Prince saw his beloved fall off the cliff, his heart was shattered and jumped in after her.

Before long, the sun came out and it was daylight. Strangely, the girl servants didn’t change into swans. Tears fell from their eyes as they said, “The Prince and Princess sacrificed their lives in exchange for our freedom.” Suddenly, a miracle occurred. The Prince and Princess Odette came up out of the water. The Prince’s love for the Princess had deeply moved god. Thus god not only removed the curse but also saved them from the water.

The Princess brought the Princess back to the castle and they lived happily ever after.

A Wise Parrot
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 1w ago
This is one of the best short story on birds with moral for kids to read. A long time ago, deep in a jungle resided a beautiful parrot. The parrot was extremely beautiful. He happily lived with his brother in the jungle. Also, read The Magician And The Parrot.

One day, a hunter was passing through the jungle. The pair of beautiful parrots caught his eye. “They will make a beautiful present for the king,” he decided. At once, he set up a trap and caught the pair of parrots. He then took them to the king and presented them as a gift. The king was happy to receive such a beautiful present. He happily accepted the present and ordered the servants to put the parrots in a golden cage. The servants were ordered to take care of the parrots day and night.

Image Source–> www.storynory.com. The parrots were well taken care of. They were fed the most delicious fruits the king’s palace had to offer. Servants ran left and right in order to keep the parrots comfortable. Even the young prince came to play with the parrots. The prince loved the two parrots and treated them with the utmost care.

“Brother, we are so lucky,” the youngest of the parrots said one day. “Yes, we were lucky to have been brought here,” the older parrot replied. “Our lives in the palace are so comfortable. We have everything we need. And above all, we are loved here!” the younger parrot exclaimed with joy.

The parrots were extremely happy in the palace. They were given everything without doing anything. The parrots were the main attraction of the palace and loved by all. They led a comfortable life.

Then, one day, everything changed. The hunter who had brought the parrots returned with another present. This time it was a magnificent black monkey. The monkey was offered to the king as a present.

Soon, the monkey became the main attraction. He was taken care of and well fed. And the poor parrots were neglected because of the monkey. Even the prince did not come to play with the parrots. “That monkey destroyed our perfect world. Nobody looks after us anymore!” the younger parrot spat in anger. “Don’t worry little brother,” the older one said. “Nothing is permanent in this world, you will see things will soon change,” the older parrot spoke wisely. You may also like to read, The Eagle And The Arrow.

Then, one day the monkey got ahead of itself and created a lot of trouble for the palace and its servants. Even the little prince was afraid of the magnificent black monkey. “Throw him out into the jungle,” the king ordered after the monkey did not learn to behave.

Due to that, the parrots again became the main attraction of the palace. “Our happy days have returned,” exclaimed the younger parrot. The older parrot smiled wisely. He knew nothing in this world was permanent. “Time never stays the same,” he told his younger brother. “See, you should not get depressed because the time is unfavorable. Better times will always come.”

Finally, the younger brother realized his older brother was right and swore never to lose his patience under any unfavorable conditions.

MORAL: NOTHING IS PERMANENT IN OUR LIVES, EVERYTHING CHANGES WITH TIME AND NOTHING STANDS STILL.

The Tower Room
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 1w ago
This is one of the spooky stories for kids to read. This story has been adapted from the original works of E. F. Benson’s, “ The Room in the Tower”. Long ago, there lived a man. This young man had a recurring nightmare. In the dream, the young man was always visiting a school friend of his, Jack Stone. The friend’s house is grim and silent.

Unexpectedly, the man had to stay the night at Jack’s house, due to a thunderstorm. So, his friend’s mother, Mrs. Stone offers the room in the tower to the young man. For some reason, the poor man is extremely scared of the room. In his dreams, he never sees the room. The young man had a friend named Clinton. Soon, the young man was to visit Clinton’s house. The young man was surprised at the remarkable resemblance of his dream and Clinton’s house. The only differences the man could see were the names and personalities of Clinton and his family members.

As a storm had started to gather outside by the evening Mrs. Clinton said to the young man, “Jack shall take you to your room.”. As soon as he heard this, he knew nothing good would come out of it. Inside the room, he found an old painting of a woman. “Let’s move it out of the room,” the man suggested to Clinton.

The young man and his friend carried the painting out of the room. When they return they find blood on their hands. “Are you hurt?” Clinton asks. It turned out that none of them had been hurt. They both went to bed unsettled.

During the night, the storm became worse. A strong thunder clap awoke the young man. The man found Mrs. Stone’s figure looming above him. The man jumped out of his bed in fright. In the darkness, he could hardly see a thing. Another thunder clap and the room was illuminated with a bright light. There, on the wall, hung the portrait of the old Mrs. Stone, that had been taken out of the room earlier. It was old and moldy.

“I knew you would come,” Mrs. Stone said icily. “Tonight I shall feast upon you, then we shall feast together. ” Mrs. Stone began to walk towards him, the man was trembling. Somehow, he gathered all his strength and pushed the woman away. After that, he ran to Clinton’s room as fast as he could.

“Her,” the man spoke in a shaky voice, “the woman from the portrait is in my room. The po… portrait is inside the room as well.” The young man was as white as a sheet. Clinton only laughed at his friend and said, “It must be a dream.”

But Clinton too had the same look on his face when he went inside his friend’s room. The room had dirt all over the floor and a pungent smell had filled the room. Then, Clinton and the man ran away from the house without looking back.

Androcles And The Lion
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 1w ago
This is Androcles and the Lion Story for kids to read. In ancient Rome, many, many years ago, a slave named Androcles ran away from his master. The slave ran fast and quick and made it to the nearby woods. There, he took shelter beside a tree. The poor man was tired to the bone and sweating excessively. “I must rest,” he huffed and slumped to the ground.

Suddenly, the man heard a lion roaring. The man decided to change his spot after some rest. He could hear the groaning and moaning of the lion. And once in a while, the lion would let out a loud roar. “I must leave now,” the man thought. But the moment he rose to his feet, he found that the lion was coming his way. Also, read The Lion And The Boar.

Image Source–> www.howstuffworks.com. The slave froze in his spot. He observed that the lion’s right paw was bloodied. The poor lion licked his wound but no progress was made. The lion moaned in pain. Then, suddenly the lion stretched his paw out to the slave. “It’s a thorn,” observed the slave, “must be painful!”

Mustering up all the courage the slave could find, he swiftly plucked out the thorn. The lion moaned in relief and then the lion jumped up to the man and rubbed his head against him. After that, the lion left the slave alone. The man could not stay hidden for long. The king’s soldiers soon found him out and took him, prisoner. “You’ll be thrown to the lions in the arena,” the guards told him. “Well, that’s what you get for running away,” the snorted.

In ancient Roman times, it was customary to throw all sorts of criminals to the lions as punishment. The same fate awaited the slave who had run away from his master. “I can’t run away anymore,” the slave whispered softly.

Soon, the day of his execution came and the slave was thrown into the arena. The poor man was scared, “I am surely going to die today!” he cried out. Soon, the massive gates were lifted and a way for the lion to come out was made. The lion’s grunts and roars sent chills down the man’s spine. A lion stepped into the arena and roared once more.

To everyone’s surprise, the lion did not jump up to kill the man. Instead, the lion ran to the slave and jumped up to him and rubbed his face against him.  While everyone was in great shock, the man realized it was the same lion he had helped in the jungle due to his healthy behavior. Soon after this incident, the king asked to see the slave. The king demanded an explanation out the slave because of this incident.

The frightened slave finally narrated the entire story of the lion and the thorn. “I see,” the king said thoughtfully after he heard the story. “So, the lion remembered that you had helped him. Even untamed beasts know the meaning of gratitude,” the king spoke in surprise.

As a result, the man was let go as a free man and all his crimes were forgiven. As for the lion, the king ordered him to be set free in the jungle. You may also like to read, The Milkmaid And Her Pail.

I’ll help you out of your trouble. I’ve thought of something! Tomorrow, I’ll come out of the wood and carry off your master’s child. I’ll let the baby fall and you will take him back to his parents who will think that you saved him. They will never let you lack for anything again,” said the wolf.

The plan pleased the dog and it was carried out just as it was arranged. The father screamed when he saw the wolf running across the field with his child. When Old Sultan brought him back, then he was full of joy and stroked him and said, “Not a hair of yours shall be hurt, you shall eat my bread free as long as you live.” And to his wife, he said, “Go home at once and make Old Sultan some soggy bread that he will not have to bite and bring the pillow out of my bed, I’ll give it to him to lie upon!”

And from that time on, Old Sultan was as well off as he could wish to be.

They were so afraid that the wild boar crept into the underwood and the wolf jumped into the tree. You may also like to read, King Thrushbeard.

The dog and the cat, when they came up thought that there was no one to be seen. The wild boar, however, had not been able to hide himself altogether and one of his ears was still to be seen. Whilst the cat was looking carefully about, the boar moved his ear. The cat thought it was a mouse. And so jumped upon it and bit it hard. The boar made a fearful noise and ran away.

The dog and cat looked up and saw the wolf who was ashamed of having proved himself to be so afraid. When he came down, he made friends with the dog.

“Look, look,” the mischievous dog boasted to his friends, “my master gave me such a wonderful present.” The foolish dog never realized his master’s true intentions. “Why did you tie a bell around your dog’s neck?” a person asked the dog’s master.

“I was tired of his mischiefs,” the mischievous dog’s master replied. “The dog was notorious and caused too much trouble for his own good. He would creep up from behind and bite people, for no apparent reason. With a bell around his neck, he is easier to follow.” Everyone realized how wise the dog’s master was.

This is the hidden treasure story for kids to read. Once upon a time, in a small secluded village lived an old man. He had four sons. All of them had grown up into big men. Despite being grown-ups, the farmer’s sons never worked. The sons believed that their luck would take them along with their lives. “These sons of mine,” the farmer found himself wondering most of the time, “what will they do when I leave?” You may also like to read, The Greatest Treasure.

One day, the poor farmer fell sick. It seemed, the poor man would not make it. Even on his death bed, the man was worried sick about his sons and their futures. “They will surely be doomed, if they don’t do something about themselves,” the farmer thought. As all worried fathers do, he too came up with a plan to teach his sons a valuable lesson. He called his sons before he died. “There is a treasure hidden in the farmland,” the old man had told his sons before he died, “the most worthy will find the treasure.”

Image Source–> www.youtube.com. The old farmer’s sons took their father’s last words seriously. All of them took to digging up the vast farmland their father left them with. Each of them dug the farm, until sunset every day. They worked hard, digging until the entire farm was dug up. But all that work gave no result, it was just barren land.

“Where is the treasure?” one of them asked after they had dug the farm. “This just a barren land, was there even a treasure to be found?” complained another one of them. A passerby heard the commotion and came to see what the fuss was about. He saw that the farm was dug up properly. He saw the farmer’s sons talking nearby. “Young men,” the passerby called them. “Since you have already dug up the farm, why don’t you plant some seed?” he suggested. Also, read Treasure Island.

The farmer’s sons did not like the idea. After some discussions, they decided it would not hurt them much. So, they planted the new seeds. Soon the seeds grew into healthy crops. They sold the crops in the market and received a good sum of money in return.

“So, this was the treasure father was talking about,” one of the four brothers realized. Their father had tricked his sons into digging the farm, which eventually led to them planting the seeds. They realized nothing in life came free of cost, hard work was required to gain something. The four brothers overcame their laziness and worked hard for their future. Also, read Treasure In The Vineyard.

One day, the mother went into the pantry to look for some flour but did not find any. “Marbo,” the mother called, “will you go to the mill and grind some wheat?” “No, send Kallo instead,” Marbo bluntly replied.

So, Kallo loaded their donkey with sacks of wheat and went to the mill. As soon as Kallo reached the mill, she saw many people waiting their turn. Kallo too waited for her turn to grind wheat. But by the time it was Kallo’s turn, the sun had set and it had already become dark.

The miller went to sleep after pouring the wheat into the milestone. Kallo was left alone, with a small oil lamp. Around midnight, Kallo heard footsteps approaching the mill. When she turned around, Kallo found goblins sneaking into the mill. It was a whole gang of goblins! “We’ll eat you! We’ll eat Kallo!” the goblins shrieked, running around her in a circle.

“You can’t eat Kallo,” replied Kallo. “Not in this dirty old dress.” That sent the goblins scuttling around the mill and out to bring the finest dress for Kallo. “Now, we shall eat Kallo!” the goblins sang. “Not yet,” said Kallo again. “You can’t eat Kallo barefoot.” You may also like to read, The Giving Tree Story.

“Shoes, shoes, shoes,” they mumbled as they searched for the shoes. They came back with a pretty pair of shoes. “Now then, we shall eat Kallo,” the goblins sang. “No, not like this, Kallo does not have a coat,” Kallo sighed. When the goblins brought  Kallo a fur coat, she asked for a pair of gloves, then for an umbrella and so on. The clever girl made the goblins run for different things the whole night.

The clever girl made the goblins run for different things the whole night. When the daylight came, and the cries of roosters filled the air, the goblins ran into hiding. They could not survive in the daylight. Soon the miller woke up and began grinding Kallo’s share of wheat. In the meantime, Kallo loaded her donkey with the things the goblins had brought her.

In the meantime, Kallo loaded her donkey with the things the goblins had brought her. Kallo’s mother was surprised when she saw the things her younger daughter had brought in. “What is all this?” her mother asked. “The goblins in the mill gave them to me,” she replied.

Hawk and the Nightingale
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 5d ago
This is a great aesop fables story, “Hawk And The Nightingale”. One sunny afternoon a hawk set out to search for food. He flew through the sky, looking for a suitable prey. All day he flew from one place to another, but he found nothing.  “I should return home now,” hawk decided. He had become tired by now. Just when he was about to return home, a nightingale caught the hawk’s eye.

The nightingale was sitting peacefully on a branch and minding its own business. After seeing the nightingale, the hawk was extremely relieved. “Now, I won’t have to go to sleep on an empty stomach,” thought the hawk. “This nightingale shall be my prey,” the hawk thought. The hawk-eyed the nightingale greedily and flew towards the branch on which the nightingale was sitting on. Also read, The Nightingale Story.

The nightingale knew the hawk would eat the nightingale. After, catching the nightingale the hawk flew off to a rock. When they reached the rock, the nightingale tried to plead for her life. “Great hawk,” the nightingale started, “I sing sweetly. I will sing beautiful songs for you if you do not eat me.”

“Besides, I am very small for the great hawk’s stomach,” the nightingale continued. “Please, great hawk, spare my life!” The hawk laughed loudly and told the little nightingale, “But you see little nightingale, beautiful music does not fill up an empty stomach.”

“But, please great hawk reconsider,” the poor nightingale continued to plead. “I am such a tiny bird, I won’t be able to satisfy your hunger.” The poor nightingale began crying at this point. “But why should I let you go?” the wicked hawk laughed. “It is always better to have something to eat. A little catch always better than the larger catch that I have not yet caught.”

The nightingale realized it was useless to plead for its life now. It was useless to plead before a cruel enemy. The nightingale gave up and the hawk ate the nightingale in one gulp. You may also like to read, Paying Back In The Same Coin.

Swan Lake Story
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Shreya Sharma    - 1w ago
This is The Swan Lake Story. Once upon a time, there was a handsome Prince. His name was Siegfried. One day, he went hunting in the forest and came upon a beautiful lake. He saw many white swans playing in the water. As it became night, the swans went ashore and one by one changed into beautiful girls.

One of the girls was much more beautiful than the others. The Prince couldn’t help but approach her and say, “I’m Prince Siegfried. If you have any trouble, it’s my wish to be of assistance to you.” “I’m Princess Odette. My servant girls and I were put under a curse by the sorcerer Rothbart. That is why we became swans.” Also, read Wild Swans.

I’ll go look for this Sorcerer Rothbart and try to break the spell. I’ll take revenge for you!” The Prince was determined. Suddenly, an owl flew out from the dark of the forest and began attacking the Prince. It was Sorcerer Rothbart who had changed into an owl. There was not a hint of fear on the Prince’s face.After a few rounds with the owl, he had chased him away. Odette was very appreciative of him.

“Beautiful Princess, how can I break the curse?” he asked. “Only if you publicly ask for my hand in marriage will the sorcerer’s curse be broken and I can return to normal,” said the Princess bashfully. The Prince grabbed the Princess’ hand and said, “That’s easy. Tomorrow evening, my mother is holding a banquet for me to choose a bride. I’ll ask for your hand in marriage in front of everybody.”

The next day, a ball was held in the palace. Many pretty girls attended the ball, but the Prince considered no one but Princess Odette. As the ball was about to end, a noble, beautiful Princess ran into the palace from outside. The Prince excitedly grabbed her hand and announced before everybody, “Princess Odette is the girl of my dreams. I’ve decided to marry her.” You may also like to read, The Crow And The Peacock Story.

“Prince, that girl is Rothbart’s daughter. I’m the real Princess Odette!” said the girl outside the palace entrance. The Prince turned around and looked, “Yes, you’re Princess Odette. How could I ever forget your most beautiful yet sad countenance.” The fake Odette completely changed back into her evil self. “Haha! Too late! You’ve already asked me to marry you. My father’s curse will never be lifted.”

Suddenly, Sorcerer Rothbart appeared. Infuriated, the Prince pulled out his sword. In a flash, he lunged toward the sorcerer and with one stroke stabbed him in the throat. The sorcerer fell over dead in a pool of blood. “Now, I’ll never be able to change back to normal!” Princess Odette overridden with despair ran over to a cliff. She jumped head first into Swan Lake. When the Prince saw his beloved fall off the cliff, his heart was shattered and jumped in after her.

Before long, the sun came out and it was daylight. Strangely, the girl servants didn’t change into swans. Tears fell from their eyes as they said, “The Prince and Princess sacrificed their lives in exchange for our freedom.” Suddenly, a miracle occurred. The Prince and Princess Odette came up out of the water. The Prince’s love for the Princess had deeply moved god. Thus god not only removed the curse but also saved them from the water.

The Princess brought the Princess back to the castle and they lived happily ever after.

Servants ran left and right in order to keep the parrots comfortable. Even the young prince came to play with the parrots. The prince loved the two parrots and treated them with the utmost care.

“Brother, we are so lucky,” the youngest of the parrots said one day. “Yes, we were lucky to have been brought here,” the older parrot replied. “Our lives in the palace are so comfortable. We have everything we need. And above all, we are loved here!” the younger parrot exclaimed with joy.

The parrots were extremely happy in the palace. They were given everything without doing anything. The parrots were the main attraction of the palace and loved by all. They led a comfortable life.

Then, one day, everything changed. The hunter who had brought the parrots returned with another present. This time it was a magnificent black monkey. The monkey was offered to the king as a present.

Soon, the monkey became the main attraction. He was taken care of and well fed. And the poor parrots were neglected because of the monkey. Even the prince did not come to play with the parrots. “That monkey destroyed our perfect world. Nobody looks after us anymore!” the younger parrot spat in anger. “Don’t worry little brother,” the older one said. “Nothing is permanent in this world, you will see things will soon change,” the older parrot spoke wisely. You may also like to read, The Eagle And The Arrow.

Then, one day the monkey got ahead of itself and created a lot of trouble for the palace and its servants. Even the little prince was afraid of the magnificent black monkey. “Throw him out into the jungle,” the king ordered after the monkey did not learn to behave.

Due to that, the parrots again became the main attraction of the palace. “Our happy days have returned,” exclaimed the younger parrot. The older parrot smiled wisely. He knew nothing in this world was permanent. “Time never stays the same,” he told his younger brother. “See, you should not get depressed because the time is unfavorable. Better times will always come.”

Finally, the younger brother realized his older brother was right and swore never to lose his patience under any unfavorable conditions.

This young man had a recurring nightmare. In the dream, the young man was always visiting a school friend of his, Jack Stone. The friend’s house is grim and silent.

Unexpectedly, the man had to stay the night at Jack’s house, due to a thunderstorm. So, his friend’s mother, Mrs. Stone offers the room in the tower to the young man. For some reason, the poor man is extremely scared of the room. In his dreams, he never sees the room. The young man had a friend named Clinton. Soon, the young man was to visit Clinton’s house.

As a storm had started to gather outside by the evening Mrs. Clinton said to the young man, “Jack shall take you to your room.”. As soon as he heard this, he knew nothing good would come out of it. Inside the room, he found an old painting of a woman. “Let’s move it out of the room,” the man suggested to Clinton.

The young man and his friend carried the painting out of the room. When they return they find blood on their hands. “Are you hurt?” Clinton asks. It turned out that none of them had been hurt. They both went to bed unsettled.

During the night, the storm became worse. A strong thunder clap awoke the young man. The man found Mrs. Stone’s figure looming above him. The man jumped out of his bed in fright. In the darkness, he could hardly see a thing. Another thunder clap and the room was illuminated with a bright light. There, on the wall, hung the portrait of the old Mrs. Stone, that had been taken out of the room earlier. It was old and moldy.

“I knew you would come,” Mrs. Stone said icily. “Tonight I shall feast upon you, then we shall feast together. ” Mrs. Stone began to walk towards him, the man was trembling. Somehow, he gathered all his strength and pushed the woman away. After that, he ran to Clinton’s room as fast as he could.

“Her,” the man spoke in a shaky voice, “the woman from the portrait is in my room. The po… portrait is inside the room as well.” The young man was as white as a sheet. Clinton only laughed at his friend and said, “It must be a dream.”

But Clinton too had the same look on his face when he went inside his friend’s room. The room had dirt all over the floor and a pungent smell had filled the room. Then, Clinton and the man ran away from the house without looking back.

Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 1w ago
This is Androcles and the Lion Story for kids to read. In ancient Rome, many, many years ago, a slave named Androcles ran away from his master. The slave ran fast and quick and made it to the nearby woods. There, he took shelter beside a tree. The poor man was tired to the bone and sweating excessively. “I must rest,” he huffed and slumped to the ground.

Suddenly, the man heard a lion roaring. The man decided to change his spot after some rest. He could hear the groaning and moaning of the lion. And once in a while, the lion would let out a loud roar. “I must leave now,” the man thought. But the moment he rose to his feet, he found that the lion was coming his way.

The lion moaned in pain. Then, suddenly the lion stretched his paw out to the slave. “It’s a thorn,” observed the slave, “must be painful!”

Mustering up all the courage the slave could find, he swiftly plucked out the thorn. The lion moaned in relief and then the lion jumped up to the man and rubbed his head against him. After that, the lion left the slave alone. The man could not stay hidden for long. The king’s soldiers soon found him out and took him, prisoner. “You’ll be thrown to the lions in the arena,” the guards told him. “Well, that’s what you get for running away,” the snorted.

In ancient Roman times, it was customary to throw all sorts of criminals to the lions as punishment. The same fate awaited the slave who had run away from his master. “I can’t run away anymore,” the slave whispered softly.

Soon, the day of his execution came and the slave was thrown into the arena. The poor man was scared, “I am surely going to die today!” he cried out. Soon, the massive gates were lifted and a way for the lion to come out was made. The lion’s grunts and roars sent chills down the man’s spine. A lion stepped into the arena and roared once more.

To everyone’s surprise, the lion did not jump up to kill the man. Instead, the lion ran to the slave and jumped up to him and rubbed his face against him.  While everyone was in great shock, the man realized it was the same lion he had helped in the jungle due to his healthy behavior. Soon after this incident, the king asked to see the slave. The king demanded an explanation out the slave because of this incident.

The frightened slave finally narrated the entire story of the lion and the thorn. “I see,” the king said thoughtfully after he heard the story. “So, the lion remembered that you had helped him. Even untamed beasts know the meaning of gratitude,” the king spoke in surprise.

As a result, the man was let go as a free man and all his crimes were forgiven. As for the lion, the king ordered him to be set free in the jungle. You may also like to read, The Milkmaid And Her Pail.

This is the hidden treasure story for kids to read. Once upon a time, in a small secluded village lived an old man. He had four sons. All of them had grown up into big men. Despite being grown-ups, the farmer’s sons never worked. The sons believed that their luck would take them along with their lives. “These sons of mine,” the farmer found himself wondering most of the time, “what will they do when I leave?” You may also like to read, The Greatest Treasure.

One day, the poor farmer fell sick. It seemed, the poor man would not make it. Even on his death bed, the man was worried sick about his sons and their futures. “They will surely be doomed, if they don’t do something about themselves,” the farmer thought. As all worried fathers do, he too came up with a plan to teach his sons a valuable lesson. He called his sons before he died. “There is a treasure hidden in the farmland,” the old man had told his sons before he died, “the most worthy will find the treasure.”

Each of them dug the farm, until sunset every day. They worked hard, digging until the entire farm was dug up. But all that work gave no result, it was just barren land.

“Where is the treasure?” one of them asked after they had dug the farm. “This just a barren land, was there even a treasure to be found?” complained another one of them. A passerby heard the commotion and came to see what the fuss was about. He saw that the farm was dug up properly. He saw the farmer’s sons talking nearby. “Young men,” the passerby called them. “Since you have already dug up the farm, why don’t you plant some seed?” he suggested. Also, read Treasure Island.

The farmer’s sons did not like the idea. After some discussions, they decided it would not hurt them much. So, they planted the new seeds. Soon the seeds grew into healthy crops. They sold the crops in the market and received a good sum of money in return.

“So, this was the treasure father was talking about,” one of the four brothers realized. Their father had tricked his sons into digging the farm, which eventually led to them planting the seeds. They realized nothing in life came free of cost, hard work was required to gain something. The four brothers overcame their laziness and worked hard for their future.

One day, the mother went into the pantry to look for some flour but did not find any. “Marbo,” the mother called, “will you go to the mill and grind some wheat?” “No, send Kallo instead,” Marbo bluntly replied.

So, Kallo loaded their donkey with sacks of wheat and went to the mill. As soon as Kallo reached the mill, she saw many people waiting their turn. Kallo too waited for her turn to grind wheat. But by the time it was Kallo’s turn, the sun had set and it had already become dark.

The miller went to sleep after pouring the wheat into the milestone. Kallo was left alone, with a small oil lamp. Around midnight, Kallo heard footsteps approaching the mill. When she turned around, Kallo found goblins sneaking into the mill. It was a whole gang of goblins! “We’ll eat you! We’ll eat Kallo!” the goblins shrieked, running around her in a circle.

“You can’t eat Kallo,” replied Kallo. “Not in this dirty old dress.” That sent the goblins scuttling around the mill and out to bring the finest dress for Kallo. “Now, we shall eat Kallo!” the goblins sang. “Not yet,” said Kallo again. “You can’t eat Kallo barefoot.” You may also like to read, The Giving Tree Story.

“Shoes, shoes, shoes,” they mumbled as they searched for the shoes. They came back with a pretty pair of shoes. “Now then, we shall eat Kallo,” the goblins sang. “No, not like this, Kallo does not have a coat,” Kallo sighed. When the goblins brought  Kallo a fur coat, she asked for a pair of gloves, then for an umbrella and so on. The clever girl made the goblins run for different things the whole night.

The clever girl made the goblins run for different things the whole night. When the daylight came, and the cries of roosters filled the air, the goblins ran into hiding. They could not survive in the daylight. Soon the miller woke up and began grinding Kallo’s share of wheat. In the meantime, Kallo loaded her donkey with the things the goblins had brought her.

In the meantime, Kallo loaded her donkey with the things the goblins had brought her. Kallo’s mother was surprised when she saw the things her younger daughter had brought in. “What is all this?” her mother asked. “The goblins in the mill gave them to me,” she replied.

Marbo became jealous of her sister yet again. As a result, Marbo wasted all the flour Kallo had brought home. Now, on New Year’s day, the mother found no flour. Marbo was sent to get the flour from the mill. Unfortunately, Marbo gained nothing.

Marbo’s jealousy had taken Marbo to the mill, but she did not have Kallo’s wits. The goblins scratched Marbo’s face and tried to eat her. Marbo screamed out in pain. Luckily, the miller heard Marbo’s cries and came to her rescue. Also read, The Brave Little Tailor Story.

In the end, Marbo’s face was treated with the face powder Kallo had received from the goblins. And Marbo learnt her lesson. When Kallo observed Marbo’s sadness, she spilt half of her gifts with Marbo. Since that day, the mother and the two sisters lived happily ever after.

Hawk and the Nightingale
Short Bedtime Stories - Short Stories Fo.. by Basab Ghosh    - 5d ago
This is a great aesop fables story, “Hawk And The Nightingale”. One sunny afternoon a hawk set out to search for food. He flew through the sky, looking for a suitable prey. All day he flew from one place to another, but he found nothing.  “I should return home now,” hawk decided. He had become tired by now. Just when he was about to return home, a nightingale caught the hawk’s eye.

The nightingale was sitting peacefully on a branch and minding its own business. After seeing the nightingale, the hawk was extremely relieved. “Now, I won’t have to go to sleep on an empty stomach,” thought the hawk. “This nightingale shall be my prey,” the hawk thought. The hawk-eyed the nightingale greedily and flew towards the branch on which the nightingale was sitting on. Also read, The Nightingale Story.

The nightingale knew the hawk would eat the nightingale. After, catching the nightingale the hawk flew off to a rock. When they reached the rock, the nightingale tried to plead for her life. “Great hawk,” the nightingale started, “I sing sweetly. I will sing beautiful songs for you if you do not eat me.”

“Besides, I am very small for the great hawk’s stomach,” the nightingale continued. “Please, great hawk, spare my life!” The hawk laughed loudly and told the little nightingale, “But you see little nightingale, beautiful music does not fill up an empty stomach.”

“But, please great hawk reconsider,” the poor nightingale continued to plead. “I am such a tiny bird, I won’t be able to satisfy your hunger.” The poor nightingale began crying at this point. “But why should I let you go?” the wicked hawk laughed. “It is always better to have something to eat. A little catch always better than the larger catch that I have not yet caught.”

The nightingale realized it was useless to plead for its life now. It was useless to plead before a cruel enemy. The nightingale gave up and the hawk ate the nightingale in one gulp. You may also like to read, Paying Back In The Same Coin.
