If Borrower fails to maintain any of the coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance
coverage, at Lender's option and Borrower's expense. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any
particular type or amount of coverage. Therefore, such coverage shall cover Lender, but might or might
not protect Borrower, Borrowers equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any
risk, hazard or liability and might
provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect
Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance
coverage so obtained might significantly exceed the
t of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this
Section 5 shall become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts
shall bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and shall be payable, with such interest
upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment
All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies shall be subject to Lender's right
to disapprove such policies, shall include a standard mortgage clause, and shall name Lender as
mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. Lender shall have the right to hold the policies and renewa
certificates. If Lender requires, Borrower shall promptly give to Lender all receipts of paid premiums and
renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender
for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy sha
nclude a standard mortgage clause and
shall name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee
In the event of loss, Borrower shall give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may
make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Unless Lender and Borrower otherwise a
writing, any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, shall
be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if the restoration or repair is economically feasible and
Lender's security is not lessened. During such repair and restoration period, Lender shall have the right
to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure
the work has been completed to Lender's sausraction, provided that such inspection shall be undertaken
promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series
of progress payments as the work is completed. Unless an agreement is made in writing or Applicable
Law requires interest to be paid on such insurance proceeds, Lender shall not be required to pay
Borrower any interest or earnings on such proceeds. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties
retained by Borrower shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of
Borrower. If the restoration or repair is not economically feasible or Lender's security would be
ened, the insurance proceeds shall be applied
to the sums secured by this Security Instrument
whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds shall be
applied in the order provided for in Section 2
If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate and settle any available insurance claim
and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the
nsurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day
period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under
Section 22 or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower's rights to any insurance
proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, and
(b) any other of Borrower's rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by
nsurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to the
Borrower) under a
coverage of the Property. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair o
restore the Property
or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due

Security Instrument be made in one ar more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order
c) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution

Payments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at such othe
ocation as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 14. Lender may return any
payment or partial payment if the payment or partial payments are
insufficient to bring the Loan current. Lender may accep
any payment or partial payment insufficient to bring the Loan current, without waiver of any rights hereunderor prejudice
to its rights to refuse such payment or partial payments in the future, but Lender is not obligated to apply such payments
at the time such payments are accepted
each Periodic Payment is applied as of its scheduled due date, then Lender
need not pay interest on unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment to bring
the Loan current. If Borrower does not do so within a reasonable period of time, Lender shall either apply such funds o
return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, such funds will be applied to the outstanding principal balance under the Note

Funds for Escrow Items. Borrower shail pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under the Note
until the Note is paid in full, a sum (the "Funds") to provide for payment of amounts due for: (a) taxes and assessments and

payments or ground rents on the Property, if any, (c) premiums for any and all insurance required by Lender under Section
5; and (d) Mortgage Insurance premiums to be paid by Lender to the Secretary or the monthly charge by the Secretary

escrowed by Borrower, and such dues, fees and assessments shall be an Escrow Item. Borrower shall promptly furnish to

waiver, Borrower shall pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items for which payment of
Funds has been waived by Lender and, if Lender requires, shall furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payment within
such time period as Lender may require. Borrower's obligation to make such payments and to provide receipts shall for a
purposes be deemed to be a covenant and agreement contained in this Security Instrument, as the phrase "covenant and
agreement" is used in Section 9. lf Borrower
is obligated to pay Escrow ltems directly, pursuant to a waiver and Bo
fails to pay the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 and pay such amount and
Borrower shall then be obligated under Section 9 to repay to Lender any such amount. Lender may revoke the waiver as to
any or all Esorow Items at any time by a notice given in accordance with Section 14 and, upon such revocation, Borrower
shall pay to Lender all Funds, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3
